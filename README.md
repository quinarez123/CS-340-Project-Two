# CS-340-Project-Two

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

By following best practices, it's possible to create modular code that can transfer to different entities. For example, not hard coding your credentials in a module allows for other programs to utilize the same source code for their needs. A good modular piece of code will more than likely change hands during its lifetime so this means that the code must also be comprehendable and easy to read in order for others to maintain the code or modify it in order to fit their needs. Modifying the code involves changing a few variable names and there's really no reason why others can't use it to implement it into their own client/server connection. 

3. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, it's important to make a plan with each step consisting of a desired functionality that will ultimately lead to your end goal. In this project, our end goal consisted of establishing a connection between the server and client with the necessary features required by the client. My previous assignments required us to use one tool or software at a time to complete it. In this course we were required to use multiple tools at the same time, MongoDB, pymongo, and DASH, and developed functionality to allow all three to talk to each other which is something that was outside my comfort zone. With the exeperience gathered from this assignment, I now have a better understanding of the surface level details of the front and back end.

5. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
